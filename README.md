# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my project portfolio! Below are a few data-driven projects Iâ€™ve worked on that apply machine learning and statistical analysis to real-world problems â€” from ecosystem health to basketball performance. Each project emphasizes thoughtful modeling, rigorous evaluation, and practical impact.

## Predicting Frog Presence Using Climate Data  
**Tags**: `machine-learning`, `classification`, `random-forest`, `climate-data`, `biodiversity`

### Overview
This project explores how machine learning can be used to predict frog presence in Southeastern Australia based on climate data from 2017â€“2019. Frogs are critical bioindicators of ecosystem health, and their presence or absence can reveal deeper patterns in biodiversity.

### Tools & Methods
- **Data Sources**: TerraClimate climate datasets + frog audio monitoring data
- **Features**: Temperature, precipitation, drought index, vapor pressure, runoff, etc.
- **Models Tested**: Logistic Regression, SVM, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Random Forest
- **Best Model**: Random Forest â€” F1 Score: **0.8387**, Precision: 0.7469, Recall: 0.9563

### Key Learnings
- Implemented a pipeline with Min-Max scaling and model encapsulation for streamlined processing
- Balanced interpretability and performance with Random Forest
- Generated actionable insights for biodiversity monitoring and sustainable planning

## Testing the 'Hot Hand' Theory in the NBA  
**Tags**: `nba-api`, `data-visualization`, `hypothesis-testing`, `sports-analytics`, `python`

### Goal
This project uses real NBA game data to test the "Hot Hand" hypothesis â€” the idea that players are more likely to score after a successful shot. Using Python and the NBA API, I analyzed shot patterns, calculated conditional probabilities, and used statistical testing to see whether this phenomenon actually exists.

### Methods
- Accessed real-time and historical shot data using the NBA Stats API
- Calculated hit/miss streaks to test scoring probabilities
- Applied statistical testing to compare random vs. streak-based performance

### Outcome
- Visualized whether nba players showed statistically significant evidence of streak-based scoring
- Discovered that as a whole, nba players did not exhibit hot-hand effects
- Emphasized the importance of sample size and random chance in interpreting sports data

## Predicting NBA Game Outcomes with Injury-Adjusted Probabilities  
**Tags**: `logistic-regression`, `nba-api`, `injury-analysis`, `calibration`, `brier-score`, `sports-analytics`

### Overview
This project models the probability of an NBA team winning a game based on team ratings, rest days, and injury-related player absences. I focused on evaluating the impact of injuries using two distinct approaches and assessing model calibration.

### Methods
- Used the `nba_api` to generate a dataset of game-level features and player-level availability
- Engineered injury metrics using two approaches:
  - **25-Minute Rule**: Tracks minutes lost for players who recently averaged â‰¥25 minutes
  - **Usage Ã— Minutes**: Tracks all minutes missed weighted by player usage rate
- Fit logistic regression models and evaluated with:
  - **Brier Score** for probabilistic accuracy
  - **Calibration Curves** for alignment between predicted probabilities and observed outcomes
  - Coefficient significance testing for interpretation

### Outcome
- The **25-Minute Rule model** outperformed the usage-weighted approach in both significance and interpretability
- Key findings:
  - Injury to high-minute players significantly lowers win probability
  - Possession and usage-weighted injury features were surprisingly insignificant
  - Home advantage and team ratings remain strong predictors
- Documented areas for future improvement: injury severity weighting, non-linear modeling, and adjustments for end-of-season anomalies
