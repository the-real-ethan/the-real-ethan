    "In this analysis, I explore whether NBA players exhibit the \"hot hand\" phenomenon‚Äîan idea suggesting that a player's chance of making a shot increases after making previous ones. This belief is deeply ingrained in basketball culture, where players are often said to be ‚Äúon fire‚Äù or ‚Äúin a slump‚Äù depending on recent performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test this hypothesis, I use shot-by-shot play-by-play data from the 2024‚Äì2025 NBA regular season, pulled directly from the NBA API. Specifically, I examine whether the outcome of a previous field goal attempt (made or missed) has a statistically significant effect on the likelihood of making the next shot.\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying statistical methods such as chi-square tests and logistic regression, this study aims to determine whether there is meaningful evidence supporting the existence of streak shooting‚Äîor if the ‚Äúhot hand‚Äù is merely a cognitive illusion."

    "\n",
    "Before conducting any statistical modeling or hypothesis testing, it's essential to refine the dataset to ensure we are analyzing only the most relevant and comparable shot attempts. `EVENTMSGTYPE` & `EVENTMSGACTIONTYPE` will be critical columns for this cleaning process. Below is a summary of the cleaning steps we will take:\n",

    "### üéØ Key Cleaning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reduce the number of columns** to retain only those that are necessary for our analysis (e.g., player, shot type, time, result).\n",
    "2. **Remove shot attempts that were blocked** ‚Äî since these are often heavily defended and not representative of a typical jump shot.\n",
    "3. **Exclude fouled shot attempts**, which may result in free throws or affect the outcome in non-random ways.\n",
    "4. **Filter for only Field Goal attempts**:\n",
    "   - Keep rows where `EVENTMSGTYPE` is either `1` (Field Goal Made) or `2` (Field Goal Missed).\n",

    "For the purposes of exploring patterns in shooting performance‚Äîespecially relationships between previous and current shot outcomes‚Äîwe focus exclusively on **jump shots**.\n",
    "\n",
    "   We will **exclude non-jump** shot attempts like:\n",

    "   - Tip-ins  \n",

    "- **Shot mechanics**\n",
    "- **Defensive pressure**\n",
    "- **Distance from the basket**\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, these are considered *outliers* relative to standard jump shots and are removed to improve the consistency and interpretability of the analysis.\n",

    "### Results Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of my initial analysis suggest that while the effect of the previous shot outcome on the current shot being made is statistically significant, the **magnitude of this effect is minimal**. The coefficient for the previous shot made variable in the logistic regression is negative and small, and the model‚Äôs pseudo R¬≤ value is virtually zero. This indicates that although there may be some dependency between successive shots, this relationship **explains almost none of the variation** in shot outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This finding is somewhat surprising to me, especially given my personal belief in the existence of the \"hot hand\" phenomenon. Intuitively, we often perceive players to go on streaks‚Äîmaking multiple shots in a row‚Äîsuggesting a temporary boost in performance or confidence. Yet the data, at this level of analysis, appear to contradict that narrative.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this discrepancy between perception and statistical evidence has been a well-documented tension in previous research, and it likely stems from the **high degree of variability in shot outcomes**. Factors such as shot distance, defensive pressure, game context, and individual shooting style introduce a significant amount of noise that may obscure more subtle sequential patterns. Without accounting for these confounding variables, it becomes difficult to isolate the true effect of a prior shot on subsequent performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improving the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the size of the dataset, I believe there is an opportunity to refine the analysis by **reducing variation and improving control variables**. A more targeted approach could yield more meaningful insights. For instance, a promising direction would be to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Narrow the analysis to specific shot types**, such as pull-up three-pointers, where mechanics and decision-making are more consistent.\n",
    "- **Limit the player sample** to those who attempt a high volume of three-pointers per game (e.g., at least 5 attempts per game). This would reduce inter-player variability and focus the analysis on players more likely to exhibit streaky behavior.\n",
    "- **Include more contextual variables**, such as time remaining on the shot clock, game quarter, or score differential, which could affect shot quality and decision-making.\n",
    "- **Incorporate player fixed effects** in the model to control for individual shooting tendencies and ability. This would allow the model to focus on within-player variation rather than being dominated by differences between players.\n",
    "- Consider using **sequence-based models**, such as Markov chains or hidden Markov models, which may be better suited to capturing streaky behavior and underlying \"hot\" or \"cold\" shooting states.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "In sum, the current analysis suggests that the hot hand effect is not strongly supported by a simple logistic regression using all shot types and players. However, this does not rule out its existence. Instead, it highlights the importance of controlling for **context and player-level effects** in uncovering more nuanced performance patterns. Future work will focus on refining the dataset and model to better account for variability and test the hot hand hypothesis under more controlled and realistic conditions.\n"
